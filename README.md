# A substrate runtime module library (SRML) for Etherem flavored WebAssembly (ewasm) 

This project creates software for substrate-based blockchains to fully support the ewasm virtual machine and smart contracts. Ewasm, short for Ethereum flavored WebAssembly, is the next-generation on-chain execution engine for the Ethereum blockchains.

The Second State Virtual Machine (SSVM) has an extension that handles all EEI host function calls, making it fully compatible with Ewasm.
